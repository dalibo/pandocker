```console
docker run [...] --from dokuwiki source.doku.txt --to markdown
```


### Emojis ! üòé

Emojis are supported with the latex engine for PDF output (they were already
supported for revealjs and HTML outputs).

Simply add the following `header-include` parameter in your documents

```markdown
---
title: Hello, üåç
header-includes: |
    \usepackage{xltxtra}
    \usepackage{xelatexemoji}

```

### Mustache

Pandocker now allows you to put variables into your markdown documents, with
their values stored in a separate file. The language we use is the `mustache`
template syntax.

You can simply add variables like this

```markdown
---
mustache:
- tests/vars.yml
---

Rapport par {{auteur}}, relu par {{relecteur}}
```

And then define the variables in the `tests/vars.yml` file :

```YAML
auteur: Satsuki
relecteur: Mei
```

```console
docker run [...] --filter pandoc-mustache [...]

* Docker Hub : <https://hub.docker.com/r/dalibo/pandocker/>



What's new in version 18.11 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Eisvogel, a new template for everyone

We're now shipping a latex template inside the image so that you can produce a
nice PDF without installing anything.

The template is called [eisvogel] and you can use it simply by adding
`--template=eisvogel` to your compilation lines:

```
docker run [...] --pdf-engine=xelatex --template=eisvogel foo.md -o foo.pdf
```

[eisvogel]: https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template

### End of pandoc 1.x automatic support

Since version 18.03, we're using Pandoc 2 and starting with this version some
old parameters will no longer be supported. You need to check your compilation
lines and make the following changes :

* replace `--latex-engine` by `--pdf-engine`
* replace `--no-tex-ligatures` by `--from=markdown-smart`

As an alternative, you can also changer the entrypoint and call the `pandoc1.sh`
compatibility wrapper

```
docker run [...] --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/pandoc1.sh [...]
```

### Easy PDF with WeasyPrint

We're now publishing a dedicated image including [WeasyPrint], alternative pdf
engine that generates PDF files from using HTML/CSS templates.

[WeasyPrint]: https://weasyprint.org/samples/

To use this template, you can simply use tag `weasy`:

```
docker run [...] dalibo/pandocker:weasy \
                    --pdf-engine=weasyprint` \
                    --pdf-engine-opt="--stylesheet template.css" \
                    --template=template.html \
                    foo.md \
                    -o foo.pdf
```

We're currently testing this new engine, please send us feedback if you're
using it too !

* Docker Hub : <https://hub.docker.com/r/dalibo/pandocker/>



What's new in version 18.03 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### We switched to Pandoc 2

Pandoc 2 was released in october 2017 and brings tons of great new features.
It also introduce a few incompatibilities as some parameters have been abruptly
renamed:

* `--latex-engine` is now named `--pdf-engine`
* `--no-tex-ligatures` is replaced by `--from=markdown-smart`

Hopefully we added a wrapper that automatically supports both pandoc 1.x and
2.x parameters, but in the long run you should consider updating your
compilation flags.


### We lost weight

The size of the previous image was 1.2GB (uncompressed). We reduced this to
735MB. We stripped down the image by removing a lot of unused LaTeX packages.
If you're missing one, please fill a bug report here :

<https://github.com/dalibo/pandocker/issues>

### Beamer is Back !

We restored the beamer export mode. You can simply get PDF slides like this:

```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/pandoc  dalibo/pandocker:stable -t beamer foo.md - o foo.beamer.pdf
```
