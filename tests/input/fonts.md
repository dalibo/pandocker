_Apparently we had reached_ a great height in the atmosphere,
for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle.

**By the same illusion** which lifts the horizon of the sea to the
level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was
dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense
dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver.

`Looking down into` the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light
streaming through a rift in the clouds.
